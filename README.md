# Ship-Captian-Crew
Ship, captian crew game project

    Objective:
        The goal is to roll a six, a five, and a four with three dice, and then achieve the highest score possible with the remaining two dice (the ship and the captain).

    Players:
        The game is typically played with five or more people.

    Rolling the Dice:
        Each player takes turns rolling all five dice.
        The player must first try to roll a six, a five, and a four with three of the dice. If successful, they obtain the "ship," the "captain," and the "crew."

    Scoring the Ship, Captain, and Crew:
        Once a player has successfully rolled a six, a five, and a four, they can start scoring points with the remaining two dice 
   
    Winning:
        The game can continue for a set number of rounds or until players decide to conclude.
        The player with the most points at the end of the game is declared the overall winner.
